  intro="GoChain is a Web3 platform designed to turn everyday environmental actions into measurable, verifiable on-chain impact — bridging the gap between individual behavior and real-world ecological outcomes."
  problem="Environmental programs lacked a trustworthy, transparent mechanism to record and reward individual impact. Traditional systems were opaque, easily gamed, and disconnected from actual ecological data. Users had no meaningful way to verify their contributions were real, and organizations had no scalable infrastructure to administer incentive programs."
  approach="I designed and built a blockchain-integrated platform that tokenizes verified environmental actions. The system connects real-world data sources (GPS, photo verification, partner APIs) to smart contracts that mint impact tokens when validated milestones are hit. The frontend was designed to make Web3 invisible to end users — no seed phrases, no gas confusion, just a clean onboarding flow."
  solution="The platform shipped with a mobile-first web app, a back-office dashboard for environmental partners, and an on-chain registry of impact events. A custom verification pipeline cross-references submissions with partner data before triggering contract calls. The design system uses green and dark tones to reinforce the environmental mission without being cliché."
  outcome="GoChain launched its pilot with three municipal environmental programs, onboarding over 400 participants in the first month. Impact token issuance exceeded projections by 30%, and partner retention was 100% through the pilot phase. The project demonstrated that Web3 infrastructure can be made accessible and purposeful outside of DeFi contexts."
